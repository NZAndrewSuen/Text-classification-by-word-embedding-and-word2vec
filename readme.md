# Project Title
Project for comp423
Student: Sun Lutian
Student ID: 300486175

## Getting Started
Dataset: 
1. imdb: for training and testing baseline model
2. newdata: The new dataset Applied by the baseline system
3. imdb_forbert: For BERT based model train
4. imdb-test.csv/imbd-train.csv: For BERT based model train

### Prerequisites
Python Environment: Python3 and ensure the Keras(2.2 or higher) installed with TensorFlow
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, ktrain are required.

#### Running the program
Ensure the development environment is correct (Strongly recommond using Anaconda).
1. baseline_dataclean.py: for data preparation.
2. baseline_system.py: the baseline text classification system with word embedding layer.
3. baseline_word2vec.py: learn a standalone word embedding using an efficient algorithm called word2vec.
4. baseline_newdataset.py: apply the baseline system on a new dataset
5. bert_model1.py: a try for using BERT based representations to modify the baseline 
6. bert_model2.py: a try for using BERT based representations to modify the baseline
